# ArcaneOS 

Welcome to the frontend for ArcaneOS! This project is written in Svelte and Typescript, making it extremely performant and easy to maintain. More information about this project contained [here](https://github.com/IzK-ArcaneOS?view_as=public).

> Note: The ArcaneOS Documentation is currently being worked on by the ArcaneOS internal team and might have missing and/or incomplete information. Please be patient.
